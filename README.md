This is the repo of a type of Ludo which is played in my village of rajasthan.
The big thing about this ludo is that is working. Means that you can move your piece in others boxes. By using a dice. The value of dice 
is between 1 and 4.There is still some work left in the game. That is killing others pieces when they are at same box.
The information about the game is in the other file naming "How to play the game and rules of the Game". Check that file to know how to play 
this game. There will be updates of the game soon. Also the game is very compact as it's size is very less. And the big things is that it is 
Maked by just using Html, Css and JavaScript. The only bad thinng of this code is that it is having a glitch, That some time the piece is not 
moved ahead. I am not getting the solution. But it is not a big deal as When the players have its turn back the piece move ahead.
Follow me to get notification when the update of the game arrives.
