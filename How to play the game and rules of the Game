This is the file which will give information about how to play this game. This is becuase this game is slightly diffrent from ludo which we play 
in our home. This game hase only one piece. But in real life it's actually have 4 pieces for each players. But has it was difficult to make 
4 pieces to move on the board so I hav maded only one piece for eac player. The Game is of 4 players. The first to reach the center home Is the 
winner. And the game will end there. There is actually some wrok is left to do. That is the killing funciton of the game. I will soon update the
game with that function. There are very simple rules of the game. That is no piece can kill you if you are at your or any other's player home.
Home is marked with the cross. In this game the dice value is between 1 to 4. And you will get one another chance if you get 4 in dice.
I hope you get how to play the game.
